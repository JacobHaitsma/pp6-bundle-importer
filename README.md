# pp6-bundle-importer
Ruby script to automatically open unimported ProPresenter 6 bundle (macOS). Waits for source server mount, checks manifest for bundle hash, imports if it exists and appends hash to manifest.
Allows the presentation creators to upload PP6 bundles to a server and not have to manually import it on machine boot. Eliminates a step in workflow.
